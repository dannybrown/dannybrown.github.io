	\subsection*{Lead Software Engineer, PepperHQ \small{(September 2017 - July 2018)}}
	Promoted to reflect the increased responsibilities I had taken on including technical recruitment, mentoring junior engineers and improving technical processes. Improvements to technical processes included a transition to a culture of pull requests and code reviews and the introduction of end-to-end testing for the API server, these changes resulted in an improvement to team velocity. Introduced Code-defined infrastructure which enabled the team to deploy more often and treat servers as cattle not pets. Led efforts to scale platform from fifty locations to several hundred, allowing Pepper to onboard more paying customers. Rebuilt strained ordering system to be independently scalable and more performant. Heavily involved in shaping technical strategy. \textbf{Tech: Node, JavaScript, TypeScript, MongoDB, AWS}
	
	\subsection*{Senior Software Engineer, PepperHQ \small{(September 2016 - September 2017)}}

	\subsection*{Software Engineer, Ripple, Microsoft Imagine Cup World Finals 2014}
	Sole software engineer for the UK team in the world final of the prestigious Microsoft Imagine Cup. Around 60,000 people in teams of 3-4 applied to compete and we were fortunate enough to compete against the top 10 teams in our chosen category: Innovation. I was selected as the Software Engineer by Microsoft UK due to my eagerness to take part and their previous positive experience of working with me on App Builder Rewards in which I showed not only technical acumen but the ability to communicate with non-technical people -- important in a competition in which the business pitch is given equal weight to the technical solution.

	Ripple, a social network which allowed users to communicate with people located nearby and literally expand their sphere of influence based on a reputation system, was developed using Azure Mobile Services (hosted node.js and MSSQL) and included a C\#/XAML/MVVM Windows Phone application. Being the only developer meant that I tackled the entire application lifecycle from specification capture through to deployment, maintenance and user support.
	\textbf{Tech: Node, MSSQL, C\#, XAML, Azure}

	\subsection*{Full-Stack Web Developer, Microsoft Corporation \small{(February 2013 - September 2013)}}
	App Builder Rewards was an effort by Microsoft to promote the development of Windows 8 and Windows Phone applications. I developed an e-commerce style website which allowed developers to use their Windows Store submissions as currency to pay for prizes such as gadgets and experience days. The site was developed in PHP -- which I had an extensive knowledge of having recently developed an IDE for the language as part of my final year project -- and utilised a MSSQL database, both hosted on Windows Azure. The site itself was a success, granting prizes to thousands of developers and spurring interest in the Windows platforms.

	\section*{Education}
	\subsection*{MSc Advanced Computer Science, University of York \small{Distinction/Merit}}
	One of five students to receive a \pounds5000 scholarship out of eighty applicants to masters level computer science courses at The University of York. This scholarship was awarded based on undergraduate performance, commercial experience and passion for the subject. The course culminated in my research project in which I developed a model-driven software tool to Query and Analyse git repositories with an eye to allowing software engineers to make more informed choices about their development processes and learn more about their projects contributors. In the taught portion of the course I achieved a grade of 99\% in the Concurrent and Real-Time Programming module taught by Professor Andy Wellings -- the highest grade in the modules history.

	\subsection*{BSc (Hons) Computer Science, University of Hull \small{First Class, Departmental Award}}
	Awarded the Computer Science Departmental Award for achieving the highest grade of a graduating student in Computer Science at The University of Hull in 2014, having achieved a first class grade in every module throughout the three years. Submitted a paper on developing DollarIDE, an integrated development environment for PHP, as my final year dissertation. Particularly enjoyed modules on Distributed Systems Programming and Languages and Their Compilers.

	\section*{Open Source and Personal Projects}
	\subsection*{LibreOffice}
	My first experience of open source development was fixing bug \#67159 in LibreOffice -- the open source MS Office Competitor. Fixing this bug involved writing some office-suite standard keyboard bindings which were missing from LibreOffice and therefore disrupting some peoples workflows when switching from OpenOffice or MS Office. These keyboard bindings were for inserting hyperlinks into documents, presentations and spreadsheets.
	\subsection*{Computer Science Blogs \small{(csblogs.com)}}
	The Computer Science Blogs network is an initiative I co-founded with a friend at The University of Hull to try to get more undergraduate students to write about their work and what they have achieved -- not only as a form of self promotion but as a way to improve their writing skills in preparation for their dissertations. CSBlogs.com aggregates all the students blogs and allows them to be discovered. The software consists of a an HTTP/JSON API, an RSS/ATOM feed aggregator, and front ends for the web and android. I used the development of the first version of CSBlogs as a sandbox for learning node.js.
	
	\subsection*{EpsilonGit}
	EpsilonGit was the productised outcome of my masters research project. Users can query and analyse git repositories of any size as domain models inside Eclipse Epsilon using the expressive Epsilon Object Language. Complex reports, such as a list of authors ordered by total number of lines of code committed which haven't been replaced by a different author, can be generated in a fraction of the time required by existing solutions. The work has been open sourced and is now maintained by the Eclipse Epsilon project. 

	\subsection*{Website \& Blog}
	In the first year of my undergraduate degree I started a blog to document interesting things I had learnt, achieved or built. I have continued to write entries throughout my career. As well as hosting my blog dannybrown.io also contains my portfolio and links to relevant profiles on other sites such as GitHub.
